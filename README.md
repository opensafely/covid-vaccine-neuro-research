* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_outputs/` on the release candidates branch 
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
